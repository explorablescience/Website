            As we conclude this first stage of our exploration, our expedition into the realm of <Color color="blue">geodesics</Color> and <Color color="blue">metric tensors</Color> has allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of our <Strong>universe</Strong>.
            We now have a firm grasp of how objects behave in space-time: they follow <Strong>straight lines at the speed of light in <Color color="purple"><Strong>curved</Strong></Color> space-time</Strong>.
            <Cite>A <Color color="purple"><Strong>curved</Strong></Color> space-time? You said <Color color="purple"><Strong>curved</Strong></Color>?</Cite>
            Yes, <Color color="purple"><Strong>curved</Strong></Color>.
            So far we have only explored the realm of <Strong>flat space-time</Strong>, where the lattice that defines the geometry of space-time changes from one point to another.
            But, in the realm of general relativity, this changing grid is directly related to the <Color color="purple"><Strong>curvature of space-time</Strong></Color>.
            In the last example we looked at the difference between a <Strong>flat surface</Strong> surface and a <Strong>curved surface</Strong>, a sphere. This, is the real essence of general relativity: <Strong>the presence of mass and energy curves space-time</Strong>.
